An elegant ancient newspaper bursts into a night of neon greens and purples,
when expression demands. A theme for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) based on my 2011 vim colorscheme

## Status

Most things should work by now.  
The nvim theme currently is an almost direct adaptation of the ancient colorscheme.
