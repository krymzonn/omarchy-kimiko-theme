An elegant ancient newspaper bursts into a night of neon greens and purples,
when expression demands. A theme for Omarchy based on my 2011 vim colorscheme

## Status

This is initial work in progress, though most things should work by now.  
The nvim theme is a somewhat hacky quick adaptation of the ancient colorscheme.

I'll likely need to adjust what can be in the theme vs what is
considered orthogonal config (gap size?)
